/**
 * Dado is a [dependency injection][di] framework for [Dart][dart].
 *
 * Dado attempts to have minimal set of features and a syntax that takes
 * advantage of Dart, which makes it different from many other popular DI
 * frameworks.
 *
 * Dado tries to make DI more lightweight by letting you define modules as Dart
 * classes and as declaratively as possible. Bindings can be define by simply
 * declaring an abstract method:
 *
 *     class MyModule extends Module {
 *       Foo get foo;
 *     }
 *
 * [dart]: http://dartlang.org
 * [di]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection
 *
 * Example
 * -------
 *
 *     import 'package:dado/dado.dart';
 *
 *     class MyModule extends Module {
 *
 *       // binding to an instance, similar to toInstance() in Guice
 *       String serverAddress = "127.0.0.1";
 *
 *       // Getters define singletons, similar to in(Singleton.class) in Guice
 *       Foo get foo;
 *
 *       // Methods define a factory binding, similar to bind().to() in Guice
 *       Bar newBar();
 *
 *       // Methods that delegate to bindTo() bind a type to a specific
 *       // implementation of that type
 *       Baz get baz => bindTo(Baz).singleton;
 *
 *       // Bindings can be made to provider methods
 *       Qux newQux() => bindTo(Qux)
 *         .providedBy((Foo foo) => new Qux(foo, 'not injected')).newInstance();
 *       }
 *
 *       class Bar {
 *         // A default method is automatically injected with dependencies
 *         Bar(Foo foo);
 *       }
 *
 *       main() {
 *         var injector = new Injector([MyModule]);
 *         Bar bar = injector.getInstance(Bar);
 *       }
